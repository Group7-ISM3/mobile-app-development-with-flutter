# Group 7 - ISM3 ASSIGNMENT 2
Submission of assignment of allowing to familiarize with programs using dart programing languages.
Below is a description for each dart program file.

## 1-smallest_int.dart
This program returns the smallest interger in a list by using function signature "(int getSmallestInterger(List<int>myList))".

## 2-search_int.dart
This program searches for the first occurence of an interger in a list and returns its index using signature "(int findIndexOfFirstOccurence(List<int>myList, int target))".

## 3-print_triangle.dart
This program prints a right-angled triangle with a given height using (*) using signature "(void printRightAngleTriangle(int height))".

## 4-factorize.dart
This program factorize an input number into its prime factors using signature "(List<int>factorizeToPrimeNumbers(int number))"

## 5-sum_even.dart
This program takes a list of intergers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list using signature "(int sumOfEvenNumbers(List<int>numbers))".

## 6-char_frequency.dart
This program takes a stringas input and returns a map containing the frequency of each character (Case-insensitive) in the string using signature "(Map<String, int>characterFrequency(String inputString))"

## 7-is_prime.dart
This program checks whether a given interger is a prime or not using signature"(bool isPrime(int number))".

## 8-two_indices.dart
This program has a function in which when given a list of intergers and an interger target, return indices of the twonumbers such that they add up to target by using signature "(List<int>findTwoNumbersWithSum(List<int>numbers, int target)".

## 9-int_to_roman.dart
This program has a function that accepts an interger and converts it to a roman numeral string using signature "(String intToRoman(int number))".
